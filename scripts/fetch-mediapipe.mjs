/**
 * Puts the MediaPipe runtime and hand-landmarker model into public/mediapipe.
 *
 * These are served from our own origin rather than a CDN so the try-on works
 * offline, under a strict CSP, and without a third-party learning that someone
 * opened the page. But they are 41 MB of binaries that are entirely reproducible
 * — the WASM is copied out of the installed package, and the model is a versioned
 * Google artifact — so they are fetched here instead of committed.
 *
 * Runs automatically after `npm install`; safe to re-run.
